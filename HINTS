the policy format of mediaconch is not well documented yet, here some observations
(date: 2017-02-20)

- within the policy-xml, no XML-comments are allowed
  (will be fixed in upcoming mediaconch version)

- tag <description /> is only allowed on top level, otherwise it will be
  interpreted as a rule with value "true". This could affect the result if next
  real rule fails. Example:
  <policy type="or" name="foo">
    <description>foo</description>
    <rule name="bar" value="baz" tracktype="General" occurrence="*" operator="=">1</rule>
  </policy>
  will always "true", even if <rule name="bar" .. /> fails.

- to express that either a stream should not exist or should exist with given properties, try this:
  <policy type="or" name="Audio">
    <rule name="Audio does not exist" value="Default" tracktype="Audio" occurrence="*" operator="must not exist"/>
    <policy type="or" name="Audio exist">
      ... <!-- here to check given audio properties -->
    </policy>
  </policy>

Expected video-sizes:
- a good source about videosizes can be found at https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Intermediate

Preservation policy for video material of SLUB:
- there is no policy officially released yet, please be patientâ€¦ :)

Howto check files against policy:
- you need an installed mediaconch
- on Bash call:
  $> mediaconch --Policy=SLUB_mediaconch_policy_retrodigitized_film35mm.xml -fh file-to-test.mkv > report.html
