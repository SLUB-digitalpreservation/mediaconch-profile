the policy format of mediaconch is not well documented yet, here some observations
(date: 2017-02-20)

- within the policy-xml there are no XML-comments allowed
- tag <description /> is only allowed on top level, otherwise it will be
interpreted as a rule with value "true". This could affect the result if next
real rule fails. Example:
  <policy type="or" name="foo">
    <description>foo</description>
    <rule name="bar" value="baz" tracktype="General" occurrence="*" operator="=">1</rule>
  </policy>
will always "true", also if <rule name="bar" .. /> fails.
- there is no way to express an "optional depends". This means you can't
  express a rule like "Either Audio or not, but if Audio it must be a FLAC"



Expected video-sizes:
- a good source about videosizes could be https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Intermediate


Preservation policy for video material of SLUB:
- there is no policy offically released yet, please be patientâ€¦ :)

Howto check files against policy:
- you need an installed mediaconch
- on Bash call:
  $> mediaconch --Policy=SLUB_mediaconch_policy_retrodigitized_film35mm.xml -fh file-to-test.mkv > report.html
